## 📌 **Project Introduction**
Welcome to the **BattleShip Game** project! This is your chance to create a terminal-based version of the classic strategy game.
Your mission? **Sink all your opponent’s ships before they sink yours!**

> 🎯 **Objective:** Strengthen your Java programming skills while mastering the principles of **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)**.

## 🎮 **Game Rules**

### 🎲 **1. Game Board**
- The game uses a **10x10 grid** for each player.
- Rows are labeled with numbers (`0 to 9`) and columns with letters (`A to J`).

### 🛥️ **2. Ship Placement**
- Players place their ships on the grid.
- Ships can be positioned **horizontally** or **vertically**.
- Ships must **not overlap** or go out of bounds.

### 🛳️ **3. Types of Ships**
| 🛥 **Ship Type**      | ✂️ **Size (Cells)** |
|----------------------|--------------------|
| 🛥 Aircraft Carrier   | 5                  |
| 🛥 Battleship         | 4                  |
| 💧 Submarine          | 3                  |
| ⚓ Patrol Boat         | 2                  |

### 🎯 **4. Gameplay Mechanics**
- Players take turns entering target coordinates (e.g., `B5`).
- Possible outcomes:
  - **Hit:** Part of a ship is hit.
  - **Miss:** No ship is hit.
  - **Ship Sunk:** All parts of a ship are destroyed.

### 🏆 **5. Winning Condition**
- The first player to sink **all opponent ships** wins the game.

## 🔧 **Required Features**

### ✅ **1. Terminal-Based Gameplay**
- The entire game should run in the terminal.
- Players interact by typing commands.

### ✅ **2. Input Validation**
- Handle and validate player inputs:
  - Ensure coordinates are within the grid.
  - Prevent ships from overlapping or going out of bounds.
  - Disallow repeated targeting of the same cell.

### ✅ **3. Display Game State**
- Show the current grid status after each move, including hits, misses, and sunken ships.

### ✅ **4. Turn-Based System**
- Players alternate turns.
- Consider implementing a **player vs computer** mode for added complexity.

### ✅ **5. Endgame Announcement**
- Clearly announce the winner at the end.

## 💡 **Suggested Class Structure**

### **1. `Game`**
- Manages the main game flow, turn order, and win conditions.

### **2. `Player`**
- Stores player information, including the game board and ships.

### **3. `Board`**
- Manages the player’s grid and keeps track of hits, misses, and ship positions.

### **4. `Ship`**
- Handles properties like size, position, and damage tracking.

### **5. `Coordinate`**
- Encapsulates a grid position for easy reference.

### **6. `Utils`**
- Provides helper functions for input validation, game status updates, and board display.

## 🛠️ **Optional Features**
- 🌐 **Single-Player Mode:** Create a simple AI for the computer opponent.
- 🔧 **Enhanced Graphics:** Improve the grid display for a more engaging user experience.
- ⚡️ **Error Handling:** Add robust validation and helpful error messages.
- 📈 **Customizable Grid Size:** Allow players to select different board sizes for the game.

---

## 👨‍💻 **Development Tips**
- Write **clean, modular, and readable code**.
- Follow OOP principles like **encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism**.
- Use meaningful names for variables and methods.
- Add **comments** to clarify key parts of your code.
- Test thoroughly to catch and resolve bugs.

## 🎉 **Final Note**
This is your chance to build a fun and strategic game while honing your programming skills.

Good luck, have fun coding, and may the best player win! 🚀

🛥 **Happy Coding!**
